# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This project is released for **educational and non-commercial purposes only**.
Although security vulnerabilities are unlikely due to the nature of the project,
we still encourage responsible disclosure.

Only the latest version (main branch) is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT open a public GitHub issue**, as it may expose the vulnerability.
2. Contact the maintainer directly at:

   **mark.taborosi@gmail.com**

3. Include the following information:
    - A clear description of the vulnerability
    - Steps to reproduce the issue
    - Expected vs. actual behavior
    - Unity version and platform (WebGL / Windows)
    - Any relevant logs or screenshots

You will receive a response within **72 hours**.

## Handling Procedure

- Valid reports will be reviewed promptly.
- If the issue is confirmed:
    - A fix will be prepared privately.
    - The fix will be included in the next patch or minor release.
    - Credits may be added to the release notes (optional).

## Scope

Since this project contains:
- No online services
- No user authentication
- No network communication
- No personal data processing

…security risks are minimal.  
However, issues such as:
- crashes caused by malformed input
- unintentional file access via WebGL
- build configuration problems
- unsafe 3rd-party Unity assets

**are still treated as valid security concerns.**

Thank you for helping keep this educational project safe and stable.
